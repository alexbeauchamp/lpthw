1. Using the floating point numbers allows for calculations of numbers that are not evenly divisible by 4 and 
   producing the expected result and not a rounded number.

2. Floating point numbers are representations of real numbers as oppessed to integers.  Due to the nature of floating
   point numbers being represented as base 2 fractions there is a bit of imprecision in the numbers.  Python allows for 53
   bits of precision in floating point numbers.
